                           <p9>"Chankya's Chant"</p9> <br>
                           <p10> -by Ashwin Sanghi</p10><br><br>
                           <p11>Chanakya's Chant (2010) is a novel written by Indian author Ashwin Sanghi. It was written two years after his first novel The Rozabal Line (2008) was released in India. Chanakya's Chant was released on 26 January 2011 and entered all major Indian national bestseller lists within two months.The year is 340 B.C. A hunted, haunted Brahmin youth vows revenge for the gruesome murder of his beloved father by the Emperor of Magadh, Dhana Nanda. Cold, calculating, cruel and armed with complete absence of accepted morals, he becomes the most powerful political strategist in Bharat and succeeds in uniting a ragged and broken country against the invasion of barbaric army of the Greek demigod, Alexander the Great. Pitting the weak edges of both forces against each other, he pulls off a wicked and astonishing victory and succeeds in installing his disciple Chandragupta Maurya on the throne of the mighty Mauryan empire. History knows him as the brilliant strategist Chanakya. Satisfied - and a little bored - by his success as a kingmaker through the simple summoning of his gifted mind, he recedes into the shadows to write Arthashastra, the science of wealth and tactics.

                            But history, which exults in repeating itself, revives Chanakya two and a half millennia later, due to a curse put on him by his childhood playmate and crush Suvasini, who was a part of his grand plans. Chanakya takes birth again in the form of Pandit Gangasagar Mishra, a poor Brahmin teacher in a small town of India who becomes a puppeteer to a host of ambitious yet foolish individuals - including a certain slum child-Chandini Gupta, who grows up to be a beautiful, intelligent and a powerful woman. Modern India happens to be just as riven and divided as ancient Bharat by casteist and communal hatred, corruption and divisive politics and this happens to be Gangasagar's feasting ground. Can this wily pandit, who preys on greed, venality and lust, bring about another miracle of a united India? Will the Chanakya Chant work ?</p11><br>

                        <p13>"The autobiography of an unknown Indian"</p13><br>
                        <p14>-by Nirad C Chaudhri</p14><br><br>
               <p15>The Autobiography of an Unknown Indian is the 1951 autobiography of Nirad C. Chaudhuri, an Indian writer. Written when he was around 50, it records his life from his birth in 1897 in Kishoreganj, a small town in present-day Bangladesh. The book relates his mental and intellectual development, his life and growth in Calcutta, his observations of vanishing landmarks, the connotation of this is dual—changing Indian situation and historical forces that was making exit of British from India an imminent affair.

                The book is divided into four books, each of which consists of a preface and four chapters. The first book is entitled "Early Environment" and its four chapters are: 1) My Birth Place, 2) My Ancestral Place, 3) My mother's Place and 4) England.
                
                Over the years, the autobiography has acquired many distinguished admirers. Winston Churchill thought it one of the best books he had ever read, according to his daughter, Mary Soames. V. S. Naipaul remarked: "No better account of the penetration of the Indian mind by the West - and by extension, of the penetration of one culture by another - will be or now can be written." In 1998, it was included, as one of the few Indian contributions, in The New Oxford Book of English Prose.(Highly recommended book!)</p15>

                <p18> - by R.K Narayan</p18><br><br>
                <p19>Railway Raju (nickname) is a disarmingly corrupt tour guide who is famous among tourists. He falls in love with a beautiful dancer, Rosie, the wife of archaeologist Marco. They have come to Malgudi, the fictional town in South India, as tourists. Marco does not approve of Rosie's passion for dancing. Rosie, encouraged by Raju, decides to follow her dreams and start a dancing career. In the process they become close to each other. On learning of their relationship, Marco leaves Rosie in Malgudi and goes back to Madras alone. Rosie turns up at the home of Raju and they start living together. But Raju's mother does not approve of their relationship, and leaves them. Raju becomes Rosie's stage manager and soon, with the help of Raju's marketing tactics, Rosie becomes a successful dancer. Raju, however, develops an inflated sense of self-importance and tries to control her life and he wants to build as much wealth as possible. Raju gets involved in a case of forgery of Rosie's signature and gets a two-year sentence despite Rosie's best efforts to save him. After completing the sentence, Raju passes through a village, Mangal where he is mistaken for a sadhu (a spiritual guide). Since he does not want to return in disgrace to Malgudi, he decides to stay in an abandoned temple, close to the village. There he plays the role of a Sadhu to perfection delivering sermons and discourses to the villagers and solving their day to day problems and disputes. Soon there is a famine in the village and villagers somehow get the idea that Raju will keep a fast in order to make it rain. Raju confesses the entire truth about his past to Velan, who had first discovered Raju in the temple and had developed a complete faith in him like the rest of the villagers. The confession does not make a difference to Velan and Raju decides to go on with the fast. With media publicizing his fast, a huge crowd gathers (much to Raju's resentment) to watch him fast. In the morning of the eleventh day of fasting, he goes to the riverside as part of his daily ritual. He feels that the rain is falling in the hills in the distance and he sags down in water. The ending of the novel leaves it to the reader to guess whether Raju died, and whether it rained.</p19>
